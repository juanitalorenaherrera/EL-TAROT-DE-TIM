This is an example of what the user will see after they request a reading. This is a Three-card reading. Here you can see how cards are displayed when in reverse and when upright.

# Tarot card API 
The titles and descriptions for cards was taken from https://github.com/ekelen/tarot-api
Only the raw JSON file was used and images were added from the Rider-Waite tarot deck by me :)
